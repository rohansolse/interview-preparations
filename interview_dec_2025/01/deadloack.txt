✅ What is a Deadlock in SQL?

A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions lock resources 
in such a way that each transaction is waiting for the other to release a lock.
Since both are waiting forever, SQL Server/PostgreSQL/MySQL detects 
this and forces one transaction to rollback, known as the deadlock victim.
