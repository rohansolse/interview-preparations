1️⃣ What is Angular?

Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework used to build scalable, single-page applications.
It provides features like components, services, dependency injection, routing, RxJS, and forms.


2️⃣ What is a Component?

A component is the basic UI building block of Angular.
It contains:

HTML template
TypeScript logic
CSS
Metadata (decorator @Component())


3️⃣ What is Data Binding?

Data binding connects component data with the template.
Types:

Interpolation → {{ value }}
Property binding → [disabled]="isDisabled"
Event binding → (click)="onClick()"
Two-way binding → [(ngModel)]="name"


4️⃣ What are Directives?

Directives are instructions to the DOM.
Types:

Component directive (with template)
Structural directive → *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch
Attribute directive → ngClass, ngStyle, custom attribute directive


5️⃣ What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

Angular’s DI system automatically creates and provides services to components.
It helps avoid manually creating service instances using new.


6️⃣ What is a Service?

A service is a class meant for common functionality like:
API calls
Business logic
Shared data
Injected into components using Directives


7️⃣ What is Routing in Angular?

Routing allows navigation between components without reloading the page.


9️⃣ Difference: Template-Driven vs Reactive Forms

| Feature     | Template-Driven | Reactive               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Approach    | HTML-heavy      | TS-heavy               |
| FormControl | Created in HTML | Created in TS          |
| Validation  | In template     | In TS                  |
| Use Case    | Simple forms    | Complex, dynamic forms |



🔟 What is Change Detection?

Change detection updates the DOM when data changes.
Angular checks component tree on:
Events
HTTP calls
Async operations
