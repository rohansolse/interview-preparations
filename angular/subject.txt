A Subject in Angular comes from RxJS and is used for sending and receiving data between components or services in real time.

It is one of the most important concepts for component communication.

Anyone who is listening will instantly receive that data.

It is both:

✔ Observable → components can subscribe
✔ Observer → you can push values into it using next()
