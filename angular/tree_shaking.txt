Tree shaking sounds like something a squirrel invented, 
but in JavaScript land it’s a very clean, logical trick: remove the dead code that your app never uses.

Picture your app as a giant tree. Every function, class, 
and variable is a branch. If your code never “touches” a branch, the bundler can prune it out. 
Less tree → smaller bundle → faster load.
