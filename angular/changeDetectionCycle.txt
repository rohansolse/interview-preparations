✅ What is Change Detection Cycle in Angular?

In Angular, Change Detection Cycle is the process where Angular checks:

✔ Whether any data in your component has changed
✔ Whether the UI (template) should be updated
✔ Whether any binding (like {{ }}, [ ], ( )) needs to reflect new values

In simple words:
👉 Every time something changes in your app, Angular runs a cycle to update the UI.


✅ How it works (Step-by-step)
1. Trigger happens

Change detection starts when any of these occur:
User event (click, keyup, input…)
HTTP response
setTimeout / setInterval
Promise / Observable emits
ChangeDetectorRef called manually
Zone.js catches async events

2. Angular starts checking from the root

Angular begins checking from AppComponent → child components → grandchildren
This is called the change detection tree.
