A DNS server acts as the "phonebook of the internet," 
translating human-friendly domain names like www.google.com 
into machine-readable IP addresses like 192.0.2.44. 
When you type a website address into your browser, 
the DNS server finds the corresponding IP address so 
that your device can connect to the correct server to load the page
