✅ Q14. What is a VIEW and why do we use it?

A VIEW in SQL is a stored query that acts like a virtual table.
It does NOT store data — it just stores a SELECT query.
When you select from the view, SQL runs the stored query behind the scenes.

✅ Why do we use a VIEW?
1️⃣ Reuse Complex Queries
If you have a long/complex SELECT query, instead of writing it again and again you create a VIEW and use it like a table.

2️⃣ Security
You can expose only specific columns to certain users while hiding sensitive columns.

3️⃣ Simplify Reporting
Views combine multiple joins/filters, making reporting queries shorter.

4️⃣ Abstraction Layer
Front-end teams don’t worry about joins or business logic — the DB handles it.


🎁 Why Views Are Better Than Repeating Queries?
⭐ 1. Avoid Copy-Paste Errors
If query logic changes, update only the VIEW, not 10+ API functions.

⭐ 2. Hides Internal DB Structure
Frontend/BI tools don’t need to know joins.

Example:
If you later change table names, only update the view.

⭐ 3. Security
Expose only approved fields.

CREATE VIEW user_public_info AS
SELECT participant_id, name
FROM program_participants;
