✅ What does REFERENCES mean in SQL?

REFERENCES is used to create a foreign key in a table.
A foreign key means:

➡️ The value in this column must exist in another table's column.
➡️ It creates a relationship between two tables.

🔍 Your Example
CREATE TABLE employee_projects (
  emp_id       INT REFERENCES employees(emp_id),
  project_id   INT REFERENCES projects(project_id)
);

✔ Explanation

emp_id must match an existing emp_id in the employees table.

project_id must match an existing project_id in the projects table.

SQL will not allow inserting any value in employee_projects unless the referenced value exists.
