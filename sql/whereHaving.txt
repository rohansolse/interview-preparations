Q2. Difference between WHERE and HAVING?

WHERE filters rows before grouping (no aggregate needed).
HAVING filters groups after GROUP BY (usually with aggregates).

| Feature                                   | WHERE                  | HAVING                    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Executes                                  | Before GROUP BY        | After GROUP BY            |
| Filters                                   | Individual rows        | Groups formed by GROUP BY |
| Can use aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT…) | ❌ No                   | ✔ Yes                     |
| Used with                                 | SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE | SELECT + GROUP BY         |
