| **Isolation**   | Transactions don’t affect each other | Two users booking same ticket                                  |

✅ Interview-Ready Explanation of ACID Properties
Q1. What are ACID properties in a database?

Answer:
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These four guarantees ensure that every database transaction is processed reliably, even during failures, concurrency, or system crashes.

Q2. Explain Atomicity with an example.

Answer:
Atomicity means all steps in a transaction must succeed or nothing should be applied.

Example:
When transferring ₹500 from Account A to B:

Deduct ₹500 from A

Add ₹500 to B

If step 2 fails, step 1 must be rolled back.
This prevents half-completed transactions.

Q3. Explain Consistency.

Answer:
Consistency ensures that a transaction always moves the database from one valid state to another valid state, following all rules, constraints, and business logic.

Example:
If balance cannot go negative, the DB will not allow a transaction that breaks this rule.

Q4. Explain Isolation with an example.

Answer:
Isolation ensures that multiple transactions running at the same time do not interfere with each other.

Example:
If two users try to book the last ticket at the same time, isolation ensures only one succeeds and the other sees updated data, preventing double-booking.

Q5. What is Durability?

Answer:
Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, the data is permanently saved, even if the server crashes immediately after.

PostgreSQL uses Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) to make this possible.
