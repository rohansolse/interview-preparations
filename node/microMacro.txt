🚀 Macro-tasks vs Micro-tasks in JavaScript (Event Loop)

The Event Loop processes two types of tasks:

1️⃣ Macro-tasks (Task Queue)
2️⃣ Micro-tasks (Microtask Queue)

Both are important for how JavaScript schedules asynchronous operations.

🟠 1. Macro-tasks (Macro Events)

Macro-tasks are bigger events that go into the Task Queue.

✔ Examples of Macro-tasks

setTimeout()
setInterval()
setImmediate() (Node.js)
I/O callbacks (DB calls, file reads)
HTTP requests callbacks
DOM events (click, scroll, etc.)

🟢 2. Micro-tasks (Micro Events)

Micro-tasks are smaller, higher-priority events.
They go to the Microtask Queue.

✔ Examples of Micro-tasks
Promises (then(), catch(), finally())
async/await (await creates a microtask)
queueMicrotask()

MutationObserver (browser)

🔥 Which one runs first?

👉 Micro-tasks ALWAYS run before macro-tasks
after each JavaScript execution cycle.

Event Loop Order:
Run one macro-task
After it finishes → run all micro-tasks
