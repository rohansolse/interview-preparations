🧠 What is setImmediate() in Node.js?

setImmediate() is a Node.js-specific function (not available in browser JavaScript).
It schedules a callback to be executed after the current event loop cycle is completed, 
but before setTimeout(..., 0) in most cases.

When Node.js finishes executing the current synchronous code, 
it places the callback of setImmediate() into the check phase of the event loop.

Because setImmediate() runs before setTimeout(..., 0) in most cases
(note: sometimes depends on system performance & I/O).
