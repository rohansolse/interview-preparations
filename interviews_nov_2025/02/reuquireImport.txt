what is the difference between require and import and which one is fast and why?

| Feature            | `require()`                        | `import`                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Module System**  | CommonJS                           | ES Modules (ESM)              |
| **Syntax**         | `const module = require('module')` | `import module from 'module'` |
| **Execution Time** | Runtime (dynamic)                  | Compile-time (static)         |
| **Scope**          | Can be conditionally loaded        | Must be at top-level only     |
| **Support**        | Node.js default till ES6           | Now officially recommended    |
| **Hoisting**       | No                                 | Yes (import is hoisted)       |


| Criteria                              | Winner      | Reason                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Load Time**                         | `import` ✔  | Imported at **compile-time** → faster |
| **Execution**                         | `require()` | Loaded at **runtime**                 |
| **Optimization by V8 Engine**         | `import` ✔  | Static analysis possible              |
| **Tree Shaking (remove unused code)** | `import` ✔  | Supports tree shaking                 |



✔ Conclusion

👉 import is faster because it gets loaded before execution (during compile/parse time).
👉 require() loads when the code runs, so it is slightly slower.

🧾 Final Short Answer (Interview Style):

import is faster than require because it is statically loaded at compile-time, 
allowing V8 engine optimizations, tree-shaking, and better memory allocation, 
whereas require() is dynamically loaded at runtime, which slightly reduces performance.
