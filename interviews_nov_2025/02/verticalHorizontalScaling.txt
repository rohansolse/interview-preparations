what is vertical scaling and horizontal scaling?

🔷 Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

➡️ Increase the power of a single server
➡️ Add more CPU, RAM, storage, or move to a higher configuration machine

✔ Example

Current Server: 4GB RAM → Upgrade to 16GB RAM
Single database server → Increase CPU cores & memory

✔ Advantages

Easy to implement (only upgrade hardware)
No changes in application code
Good for monolithic applications

🔷 Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

➡️ Add more servers to handle more traffic
➡️ Traffic is load-balanced between multiple machines

✔ Example

Instead of 1 powerful server → use 5 normal servers working together
Multiple database servers using sharding or replication
Add multiple Node.js API servers behind NGINX load balancer

✔ Advantages

High availability – if one server crashes, others work
Can scale infinitely (just add more servers)
Better for microservices architecture
Cost-effective using cloud auto-scaling (AWS, GCP, Azure)
