What is WCAG?

WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

Organized under 4 principles (“POUR”): 

Perceivable – users must be able to perceive the content (e.g., text alternatives for images).
Operable – users must be able to operate the UI (e.g., keyboard support).
Understandable – content and UI must be easy to understand.
Robust – content must work with assistive tech (screen readers, etc.).
