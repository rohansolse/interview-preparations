## ⭐ **How I Handle the Team as a Team Lead**

### 🔹 1. **Daily & Weekly Planning**

* Start the day with a **Daily Stand-up (Scrum)** – each member gives:

  * Yesterday’s work
  * Today’s plan
  * Any blockers
* Weekly review meetings to **align priorities & timelines**.

### 🔹 2. **Ticket / Task Division**

* Use **Jira / Trello** for ticket creation & tracking.
* Break bigger features into **small, manageable tasks**.
* Assign tasks based on:
  ✔ Developer’s strength
  ✔ Learning opportunity
  ✔ Urgency & priority

```text
Feature → Subtasks → Assign to developers → Track status → Review → Merge → Deploy
```

### 🔹 3. **Git Branch Management & PR Process**

* Follow **Git Flow Strategy**:

  * `main` → Production
  * `develop` → UAT / Testing
  * `feature/xxx` → Individual work
  * `hotfix/xxx` → Critical fixes

```bash
feature/login-ui     # UI task
feature/payment-api  # Backend task
hotfix/403-error     # Production bug
```

✔ **Every PR must include** — code, test cases, Jira ticket link.
✔ Enforce **Code Review** & **Approval from at least 1 reviewer**.
✔ Merge only when **CI/CD pipeline passes**.

### 🔹 4. **Team Collaboration & Guidance**

* Help juniors in **problem solving & architecture decisions**.
* Arrange **Knowledge Sharing Sessions** (Angular, Node.js, DB Optimization, etc.)
* Maintain **clear documentation**.
* Ensure **no team member is stuck more than 2–3 hours** — quickly unblock them.

### 🔹 5. **Quality & Performance**

* Follow **coding standards & linting rules**.
* Implement **unit tests & API tests** before merge.
* Use **SonarQube / ESLint / PM2 logs / New Relic** for monitoring.
* Do **performance review** before release.

### 🔹 6. **Communication with Management & Team**

* Keep **management updated** with progress.
* Raise risks early (delay, API dependency, resource issue).
* Make sure **team is stress-free & productive**.
* Encourage **open communication & trust**.

### 🔹 7. **Post-Deployment**

* After merging & deployment:

  * Take feedback from team
  * Log all things in documentation
  * Attach Jira ticket + PR + DB changes
  * Discuss improvements for next sprint.
