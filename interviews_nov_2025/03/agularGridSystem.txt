In Angular projects, there is no default grid system built into Angular itself — but we commonly use CSS libraries or Angular-specific UI frameworks that provide grid layouts.

Below are the best options to implement a Grid System in Angular 👇

✅ 1. Using Angular Material Grid List (Most Common)
🔲 2. Using CSS Flexbox / Grid (No Library Needed)
🟥 3. Using Bootstrap Grid System
🟩 4. Using Tailwind CSS Grid
