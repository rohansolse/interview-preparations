What Is Change Detection in Angular?
Change Detection is the mechanism Angular uses to update the DOM whenever the data in components changes.

Examples of things that trigger change detection:
- API response
- Button click / user input
- setTimeout(), setInterval()
- Observable subscription
- Promise resolution

| Strategy    | Behavior                                   | Performance             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Default     | Checks all components in the hierarchy     | Slower for large apps   |
| OnPush      | Checks only when needed                    | Faster and optimized    |
