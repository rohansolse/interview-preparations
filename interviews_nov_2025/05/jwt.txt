1. What is JWT?

JWT = JSON Web Token
It’s a string token used for authentication/authorization.
It has 3 parts:
header.payload.signature

Header – algo & type (HS256, JWT)
Payload – data (claims): userId, email, role, exp, etc.
Signature – verifies token is genuine (signed with secret or private key).
